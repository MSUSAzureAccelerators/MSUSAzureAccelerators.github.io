## About this Solution Accelerator

Azure Purview is a unified data governance service that helps you manage and govern data across different sources.

Machine Learning project life cycle involves many steps to transform raw data into insights. This process usually requires individuals with different roles/skillsets across multiple teams to collaborate effectively. Azure Purview helps simplify this complex process by providing an end-to-end lineage of ML entities and processes to enable better collaboration, auditing and debugging capabilities.

This solution accelerator helps developers with the resources needed to build an end-to-end lineage in Purview for Machine Learning scenarios.
