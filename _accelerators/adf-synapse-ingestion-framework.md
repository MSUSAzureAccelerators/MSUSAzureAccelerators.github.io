## About this Accelerator

Accelerate ingestion of data into Synapse with standard architecture pattern which can speed up migration with ease of development and also use the same for production deployment.  

This accelerator framework can: 
- Be used for migration of any database to your target database (Azure Synapse or Azure SQL Database)
- Handle incremental patterns and history loads for large tables
- Reduce development time
- Accelerate production workloads
- Scale to a larger number of tables with minimum efforts
- Work well with batch ingestion with near real time of around 10 minutes
