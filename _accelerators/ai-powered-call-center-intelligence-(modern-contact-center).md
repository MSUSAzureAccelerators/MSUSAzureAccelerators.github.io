## About this Accelerator

At many call centers, wait times, re-routing, and the human-to-human interactions between agents and customers can make or break the customer experience. Without modern tools like AI and advanced automation, many organizations find it difficult to maintain high customer service standards and improve call center employee efficiency.

The AI-Powered Call Center Intelligence Accelerator automates call transcriptions for real-time and previously recorded calls with Azure Cognitive Services by using custom speech models, text analytics, and industry-specific natural language processing. Data insights on customer sentiment, topic analysis, and other valuable call attributes are served up in a user-friendly visual dashboard in Power BI.

### Challenges

* Manual data entry during real-time conversation slows service delivery and creates errors.
* Labor shortages and high turnover add strain to call center operations.
* Varied and complex customer data privacy laws challenge compliance.
* Untapped data from historic call records is a wasted resource.
* Legacy AI transcription technologies are significantly less accurate than human transcription.

> Organizations that increased use of AI with live call center agents experienced a 61% increase in customer satisfaction.

### Benefits

* Gain highly accurate call transcription with automation.
* Increase efficiency by reducing average call duration, limiting re-routing, and eliminating repetition.
* Create better customer experiences for greater customer satisfaction and retention.
* Generate a wealth of customer insights to inform training and sales processes.
* Ensure compliance and PII protection with leading security and flexible data warehousing.
