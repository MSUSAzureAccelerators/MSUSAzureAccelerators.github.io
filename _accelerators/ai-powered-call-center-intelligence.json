Without modern tools like AI and advanced automation, many organizations find it difficult to maintain high customer service standards and improve call center employee efficiency.\n\nThe AI-Powered Call Center Intelligence Solution Accelerator automates call transcriptions for real-time and previously recorded calls with Azure Cognitive Services by using custom speech models, text analytics, and industry-specific natural language processing. Data insights on customer sentiment, topic analysis, and other valuable call attributes are served up in a user-friendly visual dashboard in Power BI.\n\n### Challenges\n\n* Manual data entry during real-time conversation slows service delivery and creates errors.\n* Labor shortages and high turnover add strain to call center operations.\n* Varied and complex customer data privacy laws challenge compliance.\n* Untapped data from historic call records is a wasted resource.\n* Legacy AI transcription technologies are significantly less accurate than human transcription.\n\n> Organizations that increased use of AI with live call center agents experienced a 61% increase in customer satisfaction.\n\n### Benefits\n\n* Gain highly accurate call transcription with automation.\n* Increase efficiency by reducing average call duration, limiting re-routing, and eliminating customer repetition.\n* Create better customer experiences for greater customer satisfaction and retention.\n* Generate a wealth of customer insights to inform training and sales processes.\n* Ensure compliance and PII protection with leading security and flexible data warehousing.",
