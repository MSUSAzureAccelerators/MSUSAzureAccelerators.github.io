## About this Solution Accelerator

The Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) is the combination of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies with the Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure to achieve more efficient IoT operations, improve human-machine interactions and enhance data management and analytics. AI can be used to transform IoT data into useful information for improved decision making processes, thus creating a foundation for newer technology such as IoT Data as a Service (IoTDaaS).

A growing industry trend is the use of AI and ML in Azure and at the edge to automate quality inspection.  At a high level, the solutions typically leverage AI image analysis and data from IoT sensors to detect product quality issues in real-time on the production line.

By implementing AI-based product quality inspection through AI image analysis, manufacturers not only reduce defects and increase factory yield but also have a direct positive impact on customer satisfaction.

### Customer Challenges

* **Defective products increase costs** in the form of returns and increased customer support
* **Late detection of faulty products** cause for increased costs over early detection
* **Customer satisfaction and retention decreases** when receiving a faulty product

> Machine Learning will improve product quality in discrete manufacturing industries by 35%

### Benefits

* **Improve customer satisfaction and increase customer retention** by preventing faulty parts from leaving the factory
* **Consistent brand quality** by actively monitoring from end-to-end on the assembly line
* **Reduce costs** associated with faulty products
* **Improve yield** of your factory line
