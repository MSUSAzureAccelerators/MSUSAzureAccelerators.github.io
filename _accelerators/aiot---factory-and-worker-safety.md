## About this Solution Accelerator

The Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) is the combination of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies with the Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure to achieve more efficient IoT operations, improve human-machine interactions and enhance data management and analytics. AI can be used to transform IoT data into useful information for improved decision-making processes, thus creating a foundation for newer technology such as IoT Data as a Service (IoTDaaS).

### Challenges that need modernizing

* **Human condition and environment monitoring**
* **PPE and emergency response**
* **Unsafe operations** due to fatigue, sleep deprivation, speeding. 

> Workplace injuries cost U.S. companies $60b per year
