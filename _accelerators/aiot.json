Organizations often struggle to spot new technologies quickly or they may miss important pieces to build their ecosystem - making them unable to move fast enough develop their potential.\n\nThe Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) is the combination of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies with the Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure to achieve more efficient IoT operations, improve human-machine interactions and enhance data management and analytics. AI can be used to transform IoT data into useful information for improved decision making processes, thus creating a foundation for newer technology such as IoT Data as a Service (IoTDaaS).\n\n### Core Azure Services That Support AIoT\n\n__IoT__                 | __AI__\n--------------------|--------\nIoT Hub             | Cognitive Services\nIoT Central         | Bot Framework\nIoT Edge            | Azure Cognitive Search\nAzure Digital Twins | Azure Machine Learning\nAzure Sphere        | Custom Vision\n\n> Gartner estimates that over 80% of enterprise IoT projects will incorporate AI by the end of 2022",
