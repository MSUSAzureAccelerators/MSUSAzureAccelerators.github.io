## About this Technology Accelerator

Intelligent Recommendations democratizes AI and machine learning recommendations through a codeless and powerful experience powered by the same technology that fuels Xbox, Microsoft 365, and Microsoft Azure.

Intelligent Recommendations is a general purpose service that offers one-of-a-kind, patented capabilities that more effectively drive desired outcomes out of the box such as “shop similar looks,” “shop by description,” “real time,” “session based”, Item based recommendations that can combine User interactions and Item Metadata. Businesses can promote and personalize any content type, such as sellable products, consumable media, documents, videos, and more.

### Business applications of recommender systems

Intelligent Recommendations enables businesses to automate relevant recommendations, including personalized results for new and returning users, and the ability to interpret both user interactions and item or user metadata. In return, businesses receive tailored recommendations models based on their needs and business logic. Intelligent Recommendations frees companies from the tedious management of editorial collections. Instead, it helps drive engagement, run experiments, and build trust with consumers.

### Example supported scenarios

Intelligent Recommendations provides businesses with a toolkit of relevant scenarios, including:

* **Personalized recommendations for end users:** Includes a list of unique content for a specific user based on their consumer habits and interactions. Businesses can recommend products, articles, videos, and more.
* **Similar items:** Based on a variety of signals (user interactions) or metadata (such as images, text, friends, or demographics). Intelligent Recommendations can recommend visually similar items in a catalog (for example, floral-patterned shirts) or show similar wine based on the description and taste notes.
* **Real-time and session-based recommendations for users:** Each customer journey can now have unique recommendations, even new customers.
* **Basket completion:** Shows complementary items for users based on what is already in their cart.

These interactions can have other metadata, such as the time of transaction, amount of money, duration of interaction, and more.

The following table describes the entire catalog of automated product recommendations available for you to integrate into your existing store experiences. Recommendations can be further distinguished by the scenario. For these cases, certain lists will have a selectable algorithm that diversifies the results returned.
