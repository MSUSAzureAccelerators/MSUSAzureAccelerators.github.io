## About this Solution Accelerator

The Purview Custom Types Tool is a solution accelerator for supporting custom connectors in Azure Purview, which is a unified data governance service that helps you manage and govern your on-premises, multicloud, and software-as-a-service (SaaS) data.

This application supports the following actions:

1. Browse existing type definitions
2. Create new enity & relationship type definitions
3. Create entity templates to simplify source scanning

When combined with the [Purview Custom Connector Solution Accelerator](Azure-Purview-Custom-Connector.html), this application provides entity templates to help create source scanning functionality.
