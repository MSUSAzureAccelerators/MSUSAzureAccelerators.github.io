## About this Technology Accelerator

Data lineage is the story of an organizationâ€™s data from the source, through all processes and changes, to storage or consumption. It provides a stepwise record of how data arrived at its current form, including both transformations made to the data and its journey through different business systems. A data lineage is essentially a map that can provide information such as:

* When the data was created and if alterations were made
* What information the data contains
* How the data is being used
* Where the data originated from
* Who used the data, and approved and actioned the steps in the lifecycle

The entire data flow is mapped to understand, document, and visualize data in all stages.

Azure Purview helps simplify this complex process by providing an end-to-end lineage of ML entities and processes to enable better collaboration, auditing and debugging capabilities.

This solution accelerator helps developers with the resources needed to build an end-to-end lineage in Purview for Machine Learning scenarios.
