## About this Solution Accelerator

Machine Learning project life cycle involves many steps to transform raw data into insights. This process usually requires individuals with different roles/skillsets across multiple teams to collaborate effectively. Azure Purview helps simplify this complex process by providing an end-to-end lineage of ML entities and processes to enable better collaboration, auditing and debugging capabilities.

This solution accelerator helps developers with the resources needed to build an end-to-end lineage in Purview for Machine Learning scenarios.
