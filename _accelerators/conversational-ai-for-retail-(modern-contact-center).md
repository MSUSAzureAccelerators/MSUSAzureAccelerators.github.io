## About this Accelerator

Contact centers are facing growing pressure to adapt digital experiences for delivery of enhanced multi-modal content. They must also minimize additional costs and improve operational efficiency.

The Conversational AI Accelerator combines Microsoft Azure AI cognitive services and machine learning into a user-friendly platform enabling you to create content once and deploy it simultaneously to multiple channels with a single click.

Conversational AI drives customer interactions with human-like responses, collecting data from every interaction in a feedback loop for optimization. Rich analytics are served to a dashboard for valuable business insights.
