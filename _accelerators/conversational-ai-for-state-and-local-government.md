## About this Accelerator

Government agencies are facing near-constant change in their information environments. This can be especially challenging when existing systems are already overwhelmed, provide limited solutions for ADA and multilingual needs, and require workers to spend valuable time manually routing calls and answering simple frequently asked questions.

The Modernized Contact Center Conversational AI Solution Accelerator combines Microsoft Azure AI Cognitive Services and Machine Learning in a user-friendly platform that augments your existing system. It automates resident engagements and deploys content to multiple channels with a single click. 

Conversational AI drives communications with human-like responses to quickly answer or re-route inquiries. Rich analytics are served to a dashboard for valuable insights that can help you serve your public.

### Challenges

* Multilingual and accessible communications are costly and critical for quality service and regulatory compliance
* Call routing can be complex and slow, requiring multiple handoffs and long wait times
* Employee satisfaction and time are lost to manual call routing and responding to simple and repetitive questions
* Volume of resident inquiries is rising while the government workforce grows smaller
* Insights from communications are not being captured to drive optimization

> 83% of government executives report that process automation with AI-powered tools makes a significant positive impact in their organization.

### Benefits

* Automate multilingual intelligent responses
* Provide a digital communication experience that is accessible and ADA compliant
* Implement efficient and effective call routing strategies
* Establish a single, trusted point of 24/7 contact for the public
* Boost workforce productivity by addressing routine inquiries
* Meet the public's expectations for digital interactions
