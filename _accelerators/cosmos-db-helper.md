## About this Solution Accelerator

Welcome to Azure CosmosDB Solution Accelerator (Azure CosmosDB Helper).

Azure CosmosDB Helper supports MongoDB API and SQL Core API interface with LINQ statements.

In Architecture perspective, it decouples the data access layer from business layer so developers can their Business Entities CRUD Operations through much streightforward way without learning specific query languages for each APIs.

Once your business logic has been built with LINQ statements with Azure CosmosDB Helper, you may easily switch two APIs (SQL and Mongo) with very few code changes.
