Manual data entry slows and introduces errors to any COVID-19 compliance effort, and many organizations lack the internal expertise to deploy automated solutions that deliver reliable insights.\n\nThe COVID-19 Vaccine Proof and Test  Verification Solution Accelerator mass processes and digitizes vaccine and viral test result forms. The AI-powered Azure Form Recognizer turns those documents into usable data that is translated into actionable insights, visualized in Power BIto help validate compliance and inform evolving health and safety strategies.\n\n### Challenges\n\n* Lack of information required to provide safe, healthy working environments.\n* Need for faster, simpler documentation submission and internal review processes.\n* Inability to meet changing internal, local, national, and union regulatory requirements.\n* Eliminate the excess cost of manual data entry and resulting errors.\n* Limited time and resources to enable development pipelines for automated form recognition and data analytics.\n\n> 80% of US organizations plan to continue requiring employees to submit proof of vaccination or weekly test results.\n\n### Benefits\n\n* Quickly verify the vaccination and test status of workforce with real-time data.\n* Significantly reduce time to deployment with pre-built solution.\n* Enable user-friendly form submission via email attachments and mobile application.\n* Easily comply with internal and external regulations.\n* Visualize comprehensive, daily insights into vaccination status and test results.\n* Reduce costs and increase efficiency compared to manual data entry.\n\n### How it Works\n\nThe COVID-19 Vaccine Proof and Test Verification Solution Accelerator digitizes the collection, analysis, and verification of vaccine and test result forms.\n\n![COVID-19 Vaccine Proof and Test Verification Flow](../assets/images/COVID_Flow.webp)",
