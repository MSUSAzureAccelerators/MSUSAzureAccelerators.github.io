## About this Solution Accelerator

A lack of consolidated data impacts issues that business users and support agents face daily.With customer complaints coming in from a variety of different sources, it becomes difficult to sort and resolve them in a timely manner.

Prompt customer care is essential for maintaining a positive image of your business, but the lack of a unified data platform can place immense strain on your team.  Common business concerns surrounding slow customer service:

* Poor business image
* Financial loss
* Slow growth

We’re here to present a unified, flexible, and scalable solution that fits your needs—no matter how big or small your company is. Customizations allow for quick, repeatable deployments that address unique challenges as quickly as they appear.

The Customer Complaint Management Solution Accelerator tackles all the challenges presented by unconsolidated data, including delayed response times, lost tickets, and customer dissatisfaction.
