## About this Solution Accelerator

The Digital Documentation for the Shipping Industry Solution Accelerator shows you how to complete shipping agreements faster, with improved security, when transacting with new and existing customers all over the world. The solution uses a private blockchain network to document every step of the order process in a way that improves the overall experience for everyone involved.

Through the use of a secure, distributed, immutable, and automatable network of blockchain platforms, every business transaction between shippers and carriers is tokenized and shared. Use of blockchain technology practically eliminates the risk of data tampering in the shipment order process, between quotation and booking, as every business participant can access the shared ledger of transaction events. This solution accelerator is focused on the shipping industry, though with a little imagination it can serve as model for any number of use cases in a multitude of industries.
