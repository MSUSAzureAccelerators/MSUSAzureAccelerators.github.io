## About this Solution Accelerator

In a digital transformation world, business agility and transparency through a distributed network between untrusted members can be crucial.​ The Digital Documentation for Shipping Industry Solution Accelerator shows how the traditional order and shipping processes in the manufacturing industry can be agile within full and/or semi-trusted business relationships. ​It reduces the time to complete business deals and empowers companies to easily and securely transact business with new companies all over the world.

​This Solution Accelerator uses a private blockchain network to track every step of the order process and improve communication, agility, and transparency. Through the secure, distributed, immutable, and automatable network of blockchain platforms, every business transaction between shippers and carriers is tokenized and shared. This eliminates the possibility of data tampering in the shipment order process (between quotation to booking) as every business participant can access their data sovereignty.​

​While this Solution Accelerator was built to improve transparency within the order and shipping processes within the manufacturing industry, it's applicable for any business process that needs transparency and traceability between business participants.

### What can it do?

This Solution Accelerator enables the customer to build a fully distributed, tokenized order process within the shipping and manufacturing industries.

This Solution Accelerator enables you to:

1. Architect fully distributed Blockchain network-based application.
2. Tokenize business entities with Token Standard Definitions (ERC Standard).
3. Consolidate and organize business token entity collections within a single business incident.​​​​​​​

You can adopt this Solution Accelerator to build any business tokenizing application.
