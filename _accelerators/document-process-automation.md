## About this Accelerator

Many organizations process different format of forms in various format. These forms go through a manual data entry process to extract all the relevant information before the data can be used by software applications. The manual processing adds time and opex in the process. The solution described here demonstrate how organizations can use Azure cognitive services to completely automate the data extraction and entry from pdf forms. The solution highlights the usage of the Form Recognizer and Azure Cognitive Search cognitive services. The pattern and template is data agnostic i.e. it can be easily customized to work on a custom set of forms as required by a POC, MVP or a demo. The demo also scales well through different kinds of forms and supports forms with multiple pages.
