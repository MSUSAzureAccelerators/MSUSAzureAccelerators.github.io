## About this Accelerator

The Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) is the combination of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies with the Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure to achieve more efficient IoT operations, improve human-machine interactions and enhance data management and analytics. AI can be used to transform IoT data into useful information for improved decision-making processes, thus creating a foundation for newer technology such as IoT Data as a Service (IoTDaaS).

### Challenges that need modernizing

* **Human condition and environment monitoring**
* **PPE and emergency response**
* **Unsafe operations** due to fatigue, sleep deprivation, speeding.

> Workplace injuries cost U.S. companies $60b per year

### Benefits

* **Decreased workplace incidents** The most important is keeping the safety of your workers.
* **Increased employee satisfaction** Appeal of the workplace for the workforce
* **Increased productivity and bottom line** Ensuring your workforce is healthy and safe
* **Meet compliance standards and gain brand credibility** Injuries can also significantly hurt a brand's credibility
