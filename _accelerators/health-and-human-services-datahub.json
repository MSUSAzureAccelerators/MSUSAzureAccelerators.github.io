Legacy or on-premises solutions do not typically allow government officials to accurately predict trends and identify patterns that affect their constituents and the people that elected them.\n\nWe’re here to present a unified, flexible, and scalable solution that fits your needs—no matter how big or small your county is. Customizations allow for quick, repeatable deployments that address unique challenges as quickly as they appear.\n\n> Microsoft’s vaccine management solution has enabled Baltimore City to be more agile in our response to COVID. It has enabled community vaccination clinics and advanced analytics that were previously unavailable. − _Michael FriedChief Information Officer, Baltimore City Health Department_",
