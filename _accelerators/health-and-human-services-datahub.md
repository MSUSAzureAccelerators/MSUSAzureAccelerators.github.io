## About this Solution Accelerator

A lack of integrated data impacts issues that government officials, data admins, and elected officials face daily.

With more people needing access to public services than ever, streamlining your county’s offerings is an important part of keeping your citizens connected and healthy.

Public health and human services concerns:

* Homelessness
* Behavioral health
* Medicaid abuse

Our data innovation hub tackles all the challenges presented by siloed, insecure solutions that many counties use. Legacy or on-premises solutions do not typically allow government officials to accurately predict trends and identify patterns that affect their constituents and the people that elected them.

We’re here to present a unified, flexible, and scalable solution that fits your needs—no matter how big or small your county is. Customizations allow for quick, repeatable deployments that address unique challenges as quickly as they appear.
