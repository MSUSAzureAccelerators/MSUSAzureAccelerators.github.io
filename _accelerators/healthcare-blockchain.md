## About this Solution Accelerator

This accelerator was built to provide developers with all of the resources needed to quickly build an initial Hyperledger Fabric Healthcare data transactionary solution. Use this accelerator to jump start your development efforts with Hyperledger and Azure.

This repository contains the steps, scripts, code, and tools to create a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain application. 00_Resource_Deployment will create the necessary supporting resources in Azure (Storage, Kubernetes, and Cosmos DB). 01_Hyperledger_Fabric_Deployment will configure and deploy a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network using Helm Packages and Kubernetes. 02_Hyperledger_Fabric_Client will install the necessary chaincode. Finally 03_Application_Deployment will deploy and host your application either locally or in your subscription.
