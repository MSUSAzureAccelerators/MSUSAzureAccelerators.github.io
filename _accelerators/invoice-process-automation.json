Manually processing invoices presents many challenges - high costs, high error risk, and process delays being among the top.  Conventionally programmed or automated processes can be rigid, costly to maintain, and difficult to enhance.\n\n> It costs 39% of businesses more than $6 to process a single invoice.  \n\nSome companies pay vendors to perform initial steps of the invoice data processing, such as manually extracting key fields and re-entering them into computer systems.\n\nThe Azure Invoice Process Automation Solution Accelerator solves for the above by automating invoice processing and analysis using Azure Form Recognizer.  Azure Form Recognizer is a cloud-based Azure Applied AI service that uses machine learning models to extract and analyze fields, text, and tables from documents or images.",
