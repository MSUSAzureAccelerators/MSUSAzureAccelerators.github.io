## About This Accelerator

The IT Helpdesk Chatbot Solution is a conversational bot designed for fast and easy integration with existing environments to provide multi-channel, multi-lingual, 24-7 support for common IT queries and requests. The solution is built with the Microsoft Bot Framework and integrated with Azure Cognitive Services to leverage the best of Microsoft natural language processing and AI, and provides more than 300 pre-trained IT scenarios out of the box.

### Key Challenges

* Large IT ticket backlogs made up of basic, repetitive requests.
* Overwhelming business demand for IT services, fueled by the implementation of increasingly sophisticated technologies.
* Resistance to self-service resources based on employee experiences with laborious documentation or a lack of resources available in popular channels.
* Inability to easily produce metrics and reports that might help optimize IT support systems.
* Highly time-consuming and expensive initial workloads for coding a knowledge base and deploying chatbots.

> Service desk agents aided by AI chatbots can spend 14% more time solving complex problems.

### Expected Benefits

* Reduces support ticket creation and grants agents time to work on high priority actions, reducing dependency on skilled agents to resolve bot-supported topics.
* Improves the employee experience through 24/7 support and the automation of mundane, repetitive tasks.
* Delivers business insights that help refine IT helpdesk operations and chatbot capabilities.
* Deploys within days, rather than weeks, through automated set-up across multiple environments.
* Comes with an out-of-the-box knowledge base covering over 300 common questions and built-in connectors to many lines of business systems, including live agent helpdesks.
* Uses pre-trained AI, eliminating the need to re-create or train a diverse set of bot functionalities.
