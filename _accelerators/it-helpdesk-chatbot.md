## About This Accelerator

The IT Helpdesk Chatbot Accelerator is a conversational bot designed for fast and easy integration with existing environments to provide multi-channel, multi-lingual, 24/7 support for common IT queries and requests. The accelerator is built with the **Microsoft Bot Framework** and integrated with **Azure Cognitive Services** to leverage the best of Microsoft natural language processing and AI. It provides more than 300 pre-trained IT scenarios out of the box.

### Key Challenges
* Large IT ticket backlogs made up of basic, repetitive requests.
* Overwhelming business demand for IT services, fueled by the implementation of increasingly sophisticated technologies.
* Resistance to self-service resources based on employee experiences with laborious documentation or a lack of resources available in popular channels.
* Inability to easily produce metrics and reports that might help optimize IT support systems.
* Highly time-consuming and expensive initial workloads for coding a knowledge base and deploying chatbots.

> Service desk agents aided by AI chatbots can spend 14% more time solving complex problems.

### Expected Benefits
* Reduce support ticket creation and grant agents time to work on high priority actions, reducing dependency on skilled agents to resolve bot-supported topics.
* Improve the employee experience through 24/7 support and the automation of mundane, repetitive tasks.
* Deliver business insights that help refine IT helpdesk operations and chatbot capabilities.

Deploy this accelerator within days, rather than weeks, through automated set-up across multiple environments. This accelerator comes with an out-of-the-box knowledge base covering over 300 common questions and built-in connectors to many lines of business systems, including live agent helpdesks. It uses pre-trained AI, eliminating the need to re-create or train a diverse set of bot functionalities.
