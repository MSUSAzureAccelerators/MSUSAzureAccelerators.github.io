## About this Accelerator

For the "last mile" connectivity of remote vision workloads while solving for anomaly object detection. This is the base code for the Manufacturing Vision for AMD64 architecture.

### Key attributes
- Pre-built code that is malleable enough that customer or partners can easily customize.
- Vision analytics system provides intrinsic value to the front-line plant engineers and workers, with unique visibility into operations and value all the way to the c-suite.
- Vision analytics change the way organizations do business for the better.
- Model retraining - biases that can get revealed during production inferencing which requires a rebalancing of representation.

### Expected outcomes
- Detect the presence of foreign objects in a production line.
- Detect errors in assembly
- Detect environment changes - camera gets knocked off alignment, lighting in the plant changes or seasonal changes natural light, etc.
- Detect safety infractions - lack of PPE, spill, leakage of product, etc.
