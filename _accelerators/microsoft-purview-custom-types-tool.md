## About this Technology Accelerator

Microsoft Purview is a unified data governance service that helps you manage and govern your on-premises, multi-cloud, and software-as-a-service (SaaS) data. Microsoft Purview Data Map provides the foundation for data discovery and effective data governance, however, no solution can support scanning metadata for all existing data sources or lineage for every ETL tool or process that exists today. That is why Purview was built for extensibility using the open Apache Atlas API set. This API set allows customers to develop their own scanning capabilities for data sources or ETL tools which are not yet supported out of the box. This Solution Accelerator is designed to help jump start the development process by allowing easy creation of meta-models for custom sources. It can be combined with the Purview Custom Connector Solution Accelerator to create complete connectors.

The Purview Custom Types Tool is a solution accelerator for supporting custom connectors in Azure Purview, which is a unified data governance service that helps you manage and govern your on-premises, multicloud, and software-as-a-service (SaaS) data.

This application supports the following actions:

1. Browse existing type definitions
2. Create new enity & relationship type definitions
3. Create entity templates to simplify source scanning

When combined with the [Purview Custom Connector Solution Accelerator](azure-purview-custom-connector.html), this application provides entity templates to help create source scanning functionality.
