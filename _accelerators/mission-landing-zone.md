## About this Accelerator

Mission Landing Zone is a highly opinionated Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) template which IT oversight organizations can use to create a cloud management system to deploy Azure environments for their workloads and teams.

Mission Landing Zone addresses a narrowly scoped, specific need for a Secure Cloud Computing Architecture (SCCA) compliant hub and spoke infrastructure.

### Key attributes
- A simple, secure, and scalable hub and spoke infracture is needed.
- A central IT team is administering cloud resources on behalf of other teams and workloads.
- There is a need to implement Secure Cloud Computing Architecture (SCCA).
- Hosting any workload requiring a secure environment (i.e., data warehousing, AI/ML and containerized applications).

### Expected outcomes
- A simple, minimal set of code that is easy to configure to suit specific needs.
- Allow experimentation and testing in a single subscription.
- Deployment of multiple customer workloads in production via command line or with a user interface.
- Develop a known good configuration that can be used for production with multiple Azure subscriptions.
