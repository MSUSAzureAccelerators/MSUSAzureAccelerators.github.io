## About this Accelerator

The Opioid Overdose Solution Accelerator is an end-to-end solution that provides a risk score that a patient will overdose on opioids in the next year that medical providers can take into account when making clinical decisions and an overview of opioid overdoses at the community level.

The individual risk score tool allows for medical providers to input a set of demographic and medical data for an individual patient, which will return the risk score for an individual overdosing on opioids in the next year, along with the percentile of that risk score. It will also return the 5 features that are most likely to increase an individual's risk of overdosing on opioids. This information is only meant to be used in conjunction with other aspects of a patient's medical history and should not be used as the sole factor in deciding whether or not to prescribe opioids.

The community level map allows for interested community members to map the number of opioid overdoses in a certain area as well as the concentration of schools, clinics, hospitals, social facilities, fire stations, police stations, and libraries. The example geography used in the community level map is King County, WA at the ZIP Code level.

Users of this Solution Accelerator will be able to customize both the patient characteristics for the individual risk score module and the geographic features & community institutions for the map view.
