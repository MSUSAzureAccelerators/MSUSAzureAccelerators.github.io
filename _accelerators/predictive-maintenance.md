## About this Accelerator

The Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) is the combination of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies with the Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure to achieve more efficient IoT operations, improve human-machine interactions and enhance data management and analytics. AI can be used to transform IoT data into useful information for improved decision-making processes, thus creating a foundation for newer technology such as IoT Data as a Service (IoTDaaS).

This accelerator predicts motor/equipment/asset issues before they happen and triggers real-time alerts for action with field service teams.

### Challenges
* Product yields are lower than expected
* Inventory scrap costs are high
* Data is siloed and is not leveraged for strategic decision-making

### Benefits
* Increase in machinery uptime by predicting problem areas and solving before they become breaks.
* Reduce maintenance costs and repair time by proactively addressing problem areas before it becomes a larger failure.
* Reduce inventory carrying costs by accurately understanding spare part inventory needs at any given time.
