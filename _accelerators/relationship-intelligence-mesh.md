## About this Solution Accelerator

Building and maintaining strong relationships with customers is key to improving customer retention and loyalty and increasing revenue.  Companies rely heavily on platforms to help them maintain customer relationships - CRM systems and Office 365 being two commonly used.  The Relationship Mesh SA brings data on the customer/seller relationship from various systems together into one user-friendly dashboard that provides actionable data about customer relationships at both the seller account portfolio and individual account level.  Companies can use these insights to manage and improve the interactions at different stages in a customer engagement life cycle.

This solution enables a user to:

* Enable **efficient, automated pipelines** to bring Office 365 and CRM data together in Azure
* Define **ruleset** to calculate the connectivity score between internal and external contacts
* Gain **timely analytics and insights** that help improve relationships between sellers with high-priority accounts
* Establish a detailed view of relationship **event tracking and a checklist** to make it actionable

### Use Case

#### Customer Analytics & Insights | Customer Analytics

This Solution Accelerator can be used with any customer looking to ingest data from Office 365 and other systems (such as CRM systems) to obtain actionable information on the relationship between sellers and their accounts.  The insights can be used to inform plans to strengthen relationships of sellers with their contacts at an account portfolio level and within individual accounts by providing insights on:

1. the strength of multiple sellers' relationships within an account,
2. the strength of a seller's relationship with individual external contacts within an account, and
3. the frequency and method of communication between seller and external contact for high-priority accounts.
