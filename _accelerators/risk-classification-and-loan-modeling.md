## About the Solution Accelerator

Between the COVID-19 economic recovery and low-interest rates, more small businesses want to borrow through the Small Business Administration (SBA) network than ever before. With a high volume of loan applications, SBA partners face challenges using the data they collect to accurately and efficiently evaluate risk and model loans. This causes application backlogs delaying loan distribution and leaving lenders vulnerable to changes in borrowers’ risk profiles.

The Risk Classification and Loan Modeling Solution Accelerator uses predictive analytics and machine learning to estimate the optimal loan size that the SBA will approve for a given applicant. This enables lending partners to process loan applications and make data-driven lending decisions quickly.

### Challenges

* Reliance on manual and low-tech application processing creates backlogs and errors.
* High volumes of loan applications lead to further bottlenecks and delays.
* Delayed loan distribution can cause applicants to lose critical business opportunities.
* Inability to quickly run and re-run risk classification limits the accuracy of assessments.
* Lack of efficient loan modeling makes it difficult to determine exactly what the SBA will approve.

> In 2021, 30% more Americans applied to start new businesses than before the pandemic — a record number of small businesses with access to SBA loan programs.

### Benefits

* Automate processes to ensure compliance with SBA guidelines.
* Improve customer experience and increase customer retention.
* Right-size loans to increase the likelihood of complete and timely payments.
* Accelerate the loan approval and rejection process.
* Support small businesses and the chain of industries dependent on them.
* Easily launch using a pre-built, pre-configured solution.
