## About this Accelerator

Businesses are using the power of data to transform their organization's systems and processes, but many overlook that impact of applying the same principles to its workforce.

The Workplace Intelligence Accelerator can help. It leverages machine learning and big data analytics to bring together and transform your data, allowing you to build and deploy a machine learning model to easily identify factors that influence productivity and engagement.

### Challenges
* Reduce meeting load and increase focus time
* Learn how the organization currently gets work done
* Learn how to maintain or change work patterns over time
* Keep valued employees in business-critical roles
* Keep internal leadership pipeline full
* Increase employee satisfaction and engagement without reducing productivity
* Measure workplace practices and understand what changes could enable productivity
* Institutional knowledge and release velocity are impacted when teams work with incomplete or inaccurate metrics

> Inspired employees are 125% more productive than an employee who is merely satisfied.
