                <h2 id="about-this-solution-accelerator">About this Solution Accelerator</h2>

<p>As the world economy starts to open after Covid-19 restrictions, many employers have to follow regulatory requirements to ensure workplace safety through the vaccination and testing of employees before they can physically return to the workplace. The two most common requirements are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Vaccination requirements</li>
  <li>Regular (e.g. weekly) testing</li>
</ol>

<p>Vaccination requirements are generally met by presenting a valid vaccination record. For e.g., in the United States, this is in the form of the CDC Vaccination Card. Therefore, many employers request a vaccination card be submitted as proof of vaccination.</p>

<p>Validating vaccination cards may be a one-time event for each employee (for now), whereas testing is an ongoing activity. Coupled with staffing shortages and the time sensitive nature for COVID-19 testing, this can be a big overhead, especially if there are many employees in the organization.</p>

<p>This solution helps accelerate the automation of collecting and processing of COVID-19 vaccination cards and test forms using Forms Recognizer. Azure Forms Recognizer is a cloud-based Azure Applied AI service that uses machine learning models to extract and analyze fields, text, and tables from documents. The solution also includes a simple test form to collect employee details, type of test and test center/location details etc. This form can be customized to include more details as needed.</p>
