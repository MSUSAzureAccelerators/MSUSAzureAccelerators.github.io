<p>The objective of the Risk Classification with Loan Modeling project is to predict how much loan will be approved by the SBA &amp; their registered lenders when a business applies for a loan through the SBA.</p>

<p>The Small Business Administration (SBA) was founded in 1953 to assist small businesses in obtaining loans. Small businesses have been the primary source of employment in the United States. Helping small businesses help with job creation, which reduces unemployment. Small business growth also promotes economic growth. One of the ways the SBA helps small businesses is by guaranteeing bank loans. This guarantee reduces the risk to banks and encourages them to lend to small businesses. If the loan defaults, the SBA covers the amount guaranteed, and the bank suffers a loss for the remaining balance.</p>

<p>The SBA works with lenders to provide loans to small businesses. The agency doesnâ€™t lend money directly to small business owners. Instead, it sets guidelines for loans made by its partnering lenders, community development organizations, and micro-lending institutions. The SBA reduces risk for lenders and makes it easier for them to access capital. That makes it easier for small businesses to get loans.</p>

<p>Loans guaranteed by the SBA range from small to large and can be used for most business purposes, including long-term fixed assets and operating capital. Some loan programs set restrictions on how you can use the funds, so check with an SBA-approved lender when requesting a loan. Your lender can match you with the right loan for your business needs.</p>
